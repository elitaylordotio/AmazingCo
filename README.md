Get all(direct and non-direct) descendant nodes of a given node (the given node can be anyone in the tree structure).

Change the parent node of a given node (the given node can be anyone in the tree structure).

They need to answer quickly, even with tons of nodes. 

Also, we canâ€™t afford to lose this information, so persistence is required.

Each node should have the following info:

a) node identification

b) who is the parent node

c) who is the root node

d) the height of the node. In the above example, height(root) = 0 and height(a) == 1.

    We can only have docker and docker-compose on our machines, so your server needs to be ran using them.

    Make a simple UI for this challenge. 


## How to Build

* git pull repo
* create .env file filled with in root directory of app
```
NODE_ENV=development
USERNAME=neo4j
PASSWORD=test
NEO4J=bolt://neo4j:7687
SERVER_PORT=3000
```
* docker-compose up neo4j
* npm install
* npm run prestart
* docker-compose up app
    (neo4j must be up and running or this will crash)

* Checkout localhost:8080

## Things that this doesn't have
This is a very bare bones quick test environment

Things it should have and doesn't
* Error handling
* Testing
* Error message
* Crash handling
* Can't swap root node
* You can remove sections of the tree from the tree
